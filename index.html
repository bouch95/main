			<h2>I use to be a badass</h2>
			<p>My first career was an a UFC fight. They acually kicked out because I was so good. You are suppose
			to stop the fight whenever the ref waves it off or your opponent tapes out. That wasn't enought 
			fun for me so just hitting them until they stopped breathing. Here are the people I have killed:</h2>

				<li>Bubba "The Big Belly" Johnson</li>
				<li>Tommy "The Two Toed" Little</li>
